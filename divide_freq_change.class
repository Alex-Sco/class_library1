!----------------------------------------

define int change_index  
!'change_index'means the first index which got another frequency setting



define char inputfilename*100

let inputfilename &1
let change_index &2


file in 'inputfilename'.30m
find



sic dele 'inputfilename'_1.30m
file out 'inputfilename'_1.30m s

for i 1 to 'change_index'-1
get next
write 
next

sic dele 'inputfilename'_2.30m
file out 'inputfilename'_2.30m s


for i 'change_index' to found
get next
write
next

!!!Note: 'get 1 to 39/ get 40 to found' doesn't work(still get 1 to 20 in the result). get next can work.

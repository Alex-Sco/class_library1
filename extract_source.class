!@extract_source.class

!AIM: extract the whole spectra into three parts to avoid platforming effect partly.

!NOTE: you should input the whole path of the file InputSourceFile if it is not in the local directory.

!Warning: the 'SinglePointStartNumber' is just the number of the first PURE single point data of the tel list, while there are still some single point data in the mapping tel list, and the tel names cannot actually be the criteria to distinguish single point data and mapping data!
